
Metadata for the Permian Basin Counties Socio-Economic Data
------------------------------------------------------------
The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) (https://www.nrel.gov/) is one of the premiere U.S. government research labs that shares information on the use and deployment of renewable energy technologies and projects in the U.S. The NREL Permian Energy Development Lab (PEDL) published a data set for socioeconomic (including energy production) data for all the counties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.

The dataset are organized into four categories: Socioeconomics, Health & Wellbeing, Jobs & Workforce, and Energy Infrastructure & Potential. 

Each category contains multiple data elements the details of those are provided in a separate file: nrel_ses_permian_basin_counties_metadata.txt

DOEd notes that "adults at this level can be considered at risk for difficulties using or comprehending print material. Adults at the upper end of this level can read short texts, in print or online, and understand the meaning well enough to perform simply tasks, such as filling out a short form, but drawing inferences or combining multiple sources of text may be too difficult. Adults who are below Level 1 may only be able to understand very basic vocabulary or find very specific information on a familiar topic. Some adults below Level 1 may struggle even to do this and may be functionally illiterate."	DOEd	2012-2017	
	Literacy_PctLevel2	Percent of county adult population with a modeled literacy score greater than 226 points but less than 276 points. DOEd notes that "adults at this level can be considered nearing proficiency but still struggling to perform tasks with text-based information. Such adults may be able to read print and digital texts, relate multiple pieces of information within or across a couple documents, compare and contrast, and draw simple inferences. They can navigate in a digital environment to access key information, such as finding two main benefits of one product over another. However, more complex inferencing and evaluation may be too difficult."	DOEd	2012-2017	
	Literacy_PctLevel3	Percent of county adult population with a modeled literacy score above 276 points.  DOEd notes that "adults at this level can be considered proficient at working with information and ideas in text.

DOEd	2012-2017	
	Numeracy_AvgScore	Model-based numeracy score, ranging from 0 (low proficiency) to 500 (high proficiency)	DOEd	2012-2017	
	Numeracy_PctLevel1	Percent of county adult population with a modeled numeracy score below 226 points.  DOEd notes that "adults at this level can be considered at risk for difficulties with numeracy. Adults at the upper end of this level can understand how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide and can perform basic one-step mathematical operations with given values or common spatial representations (e.g., calculate how many bottles of soda are in a full box with two levels when only the top level can be seen). Adults who are below Level 1 may only be able to count, sort, and do basic arithmetic operations with simple whole numbers and may be functionally innumerate."	DOEd	2012-2017	
	Numeracy_PctLevel2	Percent of county adult population with a modeled numeracy score greater than 226 points but less than 276 points. DOEd notes that "adults at this level can be considered nearing proficiency but still struggling to perform numeracy tasks. Such adults can successfully perform tasks requiring two or three steps involving calculations with whole numbers and common decimals, percentages, and fractions. They can conduct simple measurement and interpret relatively simple data and statistics in texts, tables, and graphs. However, more complicated problem solving (where the information is not explicit or is in an unfamiliar context) may be too difficult."	DOEd	2012-2017	
	Numeracy_PctLevel3	Percent of county adult population with a modeled numeracy score above 276 points.  DOEd notes that "adults at this level can be considered proficient at working with mathematical information and ideas. They have a range of numeracy skills from the ability to recognize mathematical relationships and apply proportions to the ability to understand abstract representations of mathematical concepts and engage in complex reasoning about quantities and data."	DOEd	2012-2017
